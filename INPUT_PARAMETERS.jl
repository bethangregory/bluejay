# Set the planet

    # OPTIONS: 
    # INITIAL_GUESS.h5 --> Basic Mars starting file.
    # venus_H2O1e-6_converged_c1JKkl1M.h5 --> Best Venus initial atmosphere 
    # venus_H2O1e-6_converged_vGFd5b0a.h5 ??? this was the one we use for the paper

# Set the modifiable atmospheric parameters
# =======================================================================================================
const seasonal_cycle = false  # Whether to simulate one season or run to equilibrium.
    # OPTIONS: 
    # true (short, one season)
    # false (run to equilibrium)
const exp_type = "temperature" # Goes into the filename and log to show which parameter was varied.
    # OPTIONS: 
    # temperature: varying the exobase temperature
    # water: varying the amount of water in the mesosphere 
    # insolation: varying insolation due to either solar cycle or orbital distance
    # all: all three are modified; use only with special_seasonal_case != nothing
const special_seasonal_case = nothing
    # Special case for running the seasonal model with muliple parameters being modified.
    # At the request of a reviewer for Cangi+ 2024. Note: You still have to change the individual parameters below.
    # OPTIONS: 
    # nothing - if not doing a seasonal run (note, this is not a string, it's the Julia nothing, similar to Python None)
    # Vary water, insolation, and temperature at same time: "inclusive-peri" # "inclusive-mean" #"inclusive-ap" 
    
# Temperature
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# This sets just the exobase temperature. Typically, the exobase temperature tracks the
# solar cycle. You don't HAVE to make them match, but if you don't, you need to be able to 
# interpret that choice and justify your choices when you write up the paper.
const temp_scenario = "mean"  # Temperature selection for the seasonal model run.
    # OPTIONS: 
    # min-P2, mean-P2, max-P2: uses exobase temps from Cangi+2023 (190, 210, 280) K.
    # mean, min, max: temps as in Cangi+ 2024 (175, 225, 275) K - goal for this one was evenly spaced.
    # isothermal (this will set a constant temperature at all alts - 225 K)

# Solar case
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

    # ORBITAL DISTANCE OPTIONS: "perihelion" #  "meansundist" # "aphelion"; these are defined at solar mean. 
    #     NOTE: these options are only available for Mars at present.
    # SOLAR CYCLE OPTIONS: "solarmean" # "solarmax" # "solarmin"; these are defined at the mean AU. 
    # NOTE: Not currently possible to mix orbital distance and solar cycle as I would have to generate more spectra.

    # TODO: Program the solar spectrum scaling in Julia and set AU as a parameter

# Turn plots off and on
# =======================================================================================================

    # true -- uses initial guess densities for species based on previous model output.

const use_molec_diff = true # Toggle molecular diffusion. If turned off, eddy diffusion remains active.
